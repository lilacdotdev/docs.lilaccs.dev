   - Maps standard HTML elements to custom MDX components
   - Provides consistent styling across all content
   - Enables theme-aware rendering

2. **Processing Flow**:
   ```
   MDX File → Frontmatter Parse → MDX Compile → 
   Component Mapping → Layout Wrapper → Render
   ```

3. **Component Mapping**:
   ```typescript
   const components = {
     // Typography
     h1: H1, h2: H2, h3: H3, h4: H4, h5: H5, h6: H6,
     p: Paragraph,
     a: MDXLink,
     
     // Lists
     ul: UnorderedList,
     ol: OrderedList,
     li: ListItem,
     
     // Text formatting
     strong: Strong,
     em: Emphasis,
     code: InlineCode,
     blockquote: Blockquote,
     hr: HorizontalRule,
     
     // Tables
     table: Table,
     thead: TableHeader,
     tbody: TableBody,
     tr: TableRow,
     th: TableHead,
     td: TableCell,
     
     // Media
     img: MDXImage,

## Phase 2 Implementation Plan - COMPLETED ✅

### 1. Fix Current Error ✅
- Issue: `window is not defined` in server-side rendering
- Solution: Used Next.js router for pathname detection
- Impact: Enabled proper page rendering

### 2. Route Conflict Resolution ✅
- Issue: Conflicting dynamic routes `[slug]` vs `[id]`
- Solution: Removed old `/[tag]/[slug]/page.tsx` file
- Impact: Eliminated route naming conflicts, uses consistent `[id]` parameter
- Reasoning: Our routing structure uses post IDs, not slugs, as defined in mission statement

### 3. Async Params Error Fix ✅
- Issue: Next.js 15 requires `params` to be awaited before accessing properties
- Error: `Route "/[tag]/[id]" used params.id. params should be awaited before using its properties`
- Solution: Updated dynamic route to await params in both generateMetadata and PostPage
- Impact: Ensures compatibility with Next.js 15 async dynamic APIs

### 4. Filter Transition Flicker Fix ✅
- Issue: Elements appear before fade animation starts when filtering
- Cause: Content renders immediately before animation begins
- Solution: Implemented AnimatePresence with smooth fade transitions and loading states
- Impact: Improved user experience with seamless filter transitions
- Features:
  - Fade out old content before loading new
  - Smooth fade in with subtle upward motion
  - Proper loading states during transitions
  - Unique keys for proper animation triggers

### 5. Post View 404 Error Fix ✅
- Issue: Individual post pages return 404 errors when accessed
- Cause: Tag matching logic didn't account for URL formatting (spaces → dashes)
- Solution: Updated tag matching to convert spaces to dashes for comparison
- Features Implemented:
  - "Go Back" button with ArrowLeft icon
  - Responsive grid layout (3-column on desktop, stacked on mobile)
  - Post header, description, date, and tags on left
  - Featured image on right with elegant placeholder fallback
  - Responsive typography scaling
  - Proper image optimization with Next.js Image
- Impact: Individual post viewing now works correctly with beautiful layout

### 6. Async SearchParams Error Fix ✅
- Issue: Next.js 15 requires `searchParams` to be awaited before accessing properties
- Error: `Route "/" used searchParams.filter. searchParams should be awaited before using its properties`
- Solution: Updated home page interface and function to await searchParams
- Changes:
  - Updated `HomePageProps` interface to use `Promise<{ filter?: string }>`
  - Changed function to async and await searchParams
- Impact: Ensures compatibility with Next.js 15 async dynamic APIs

### 7. AI/ML Tag URL Fix ✅
- Issue: Tags with forward slashes (AI/ML) cause 404 errors in URLs
- Cause: Forward slashes are URL path separators, breaking routing
- Solution: Created comprehensive tag-to-slug conversion utilities
- Implementation:
  - Added `tagToSlug()` function to convert tags to URL-safe slugs
  - Added `tagMatchesSlug()` function for proper tag matching
  - Updated all URL generation to use consistent slug conversion
  - Handles spaces, slashes, and special characters properly
- Examples:
  - "AI/ML" → "ai-ml"
  - "Getting Started" → "getting-started"
  - "Web Dev" → "web-dev"
- Impact: All tags now work correctly in URLs regardless of special characters

### 8. Post Loading System ✅
- **Data Source**: MDX files in `/content/posts/` directory
- **Post Structure**: Complete with frontmatter parsing
- **File Structure**: Implemented with example posts
- **API Route**: Created `/api/posts` for fetching posts

### 9. Post Display Integration ✅
- Replaced Next.js default content with post listing
- Integrated existing PostCard/PostRow components
- Connected with ViewToggle and filtering
- Implemented infinite scroll with loading states

### 10. Routing System ✅
- Dynamic routes: `/[tag]/[id]/page.tsx` implemented
